[![styled-image](/images/Optimizer_path_at_localization_1Dbar.png){: .align-left style="width: 30%;"}](/images/Optimizer_path_at_localization_1Dbar.png) The energy landscape governs the dynamics of how a solution (energy minimum) is reached. Visualizing the energy landscape helps develop intuition about its critical features and low-dimensional structure. Additionally, it can guide the selection and design of solution algorithms. However, the solution field, even in a discrete setting, is high-dimensional. By applying linear and nonlinear order reduction techniques, we reduce the dimensionality to two, allowing for visualization of the solution approach. The plots on the left illustrate the solution trajectory at the loading stage where the phase field localizes in a 1D bar.
