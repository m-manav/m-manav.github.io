![styled-image](/images/polymer_brush.png "Polymer brush"){: .align-left style="width: 30%;"} Polymer brushes are soft active materials which form from dense tethering of polymer chains on a substrate. They provide a facile means of converting chemical energy into mechanical work at nanoscale, achieved through  stimuli-induced conformation changes. Our research constituted pioneering work on the stress within a polymer brush. Our theoretical and computational work combined polymer physics theories with continuum mechanics to predict stress in a brush and its stimuli-response, and validated the results
using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Our research has significant implications in the design of brush based nanoactuators and self-folding of 2D materials to generate 3D structures using brushes, and can contribute to our understanding of the bending of a biological membranes due to the disordered proteins on their surface.
