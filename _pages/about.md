I am a postdoctoral researcher at ETH ZUrich in [Computational Mechanics Lab](https://compmech.ethz.ch/). I received my PhD from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and was a postdoctoral researcher at the California Institute of Technology previously. My research interests are in computational mechanics, machine learning for mechanics, and mechanics of polymeric materials and nanocomposites.
